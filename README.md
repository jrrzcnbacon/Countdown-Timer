# Countdown Timer

This is a simple Python script that acts as a countdown timer. The user is prompted to enter the number of minutes and seconds, and the script will count down to zero, alerting the user when time is up with a message and a beep.

## Features

- User input for minutes and seconds
- Real-time countdown display in the terminal
- Alerts the user when the timer ends

## Usage

1. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python countdown_timer.py
    ```

2. Enter the desired countdown time in minutes and seconds when prompted.

3. The timer will display the remaining time and alert you when it reaches zero.

## Example

```
Enter minutes: 1
Enter seconds: 30
Time Remaining: 01:30
...
Time Remaining: 00:01
Time Remaining: 00:00

Time's up!
```
